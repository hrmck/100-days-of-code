# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Agnes Leung

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 2021/08/24.

## Log

### R1D1 
Read the first three pages in introduction. It took me around 1.5 hours on read the main articles and the relevant links. The notes are in the Obsidian vault.

### R1D2
Finished the introduction part. Moving on to installations. Somehow The Odin Project supports unix-based systems only. I am using Windows 10. I am thinking whether I should use VM or dual-boot. (WSL is also not supported.)

### R1D3
Installed VM and Xubuntu. Not in a great shape today.

### R1D4
Installed VSCode, Obsidian (my note taking app), Git and MS Edge on Xubuntu.  
Also set up Chinese and Japanese input. I think these are my tools that I need for developing something on Xubuntu.

Then I continued following the curriculum. Learning and revisiting HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the basics for the front end. The curriculum lead me to FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certificate. However, our goal is to go through HTML and CSS first. Today I finished the HTML courses and will move on to CSS tomorrow.  
There are quite a lot of HTML tags that I don't know, such as `<kbd>`, `<main>`, `<rp>`.
