# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Agnes Leung

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 2021/08/24.

## Log

### R1D1 
Read the first three pages in introduction. It took me around 1.5 hours on read the main articles and the relevant links. The notes are in the Obsidian vault.

### R1D2
Finished the introduction part. Moving on to installations. Somehow The Odin Project supports unix-based systems only. I am using Windows 10. I am thinking whether I should use VM or dual-boot. (WSL is also not supported.)

### R1D3
Installed VM and Xubuntu. Not in a great shape today.
