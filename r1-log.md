# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Agnes Leung

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 2021/08/24.

## Log

### R1D1

Read the first three pages in introduction. It took me around 1.5 hours on read the main articles and the relevant links. The notes are in the Obsidian vault.

### R1D2

Finished the introduction part. Moving on to installations. Somehow The Odin Project supports unix-based systems only. I am using Windows 10. I am thinking whether I should use VM or dual-boot. (WSL is also not supported.)

### R1D3

Installed VM and Xubuntu. Not in a great shape today.

### R1D4

Installed VSCode, Obsidian (my note taking app), Git and MS Edge on Xubuntu.  
Also set up Chinese and Japanese input. I think these are my tools that I need for developing something on Xubuntu.

Then I continued following the curriculum. Learning and revisiting HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the basics for the front end. The curriculum lead me to FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certificate. However, our goal is to go through HTML and CSS first. Today I finished the HTML courses and will move on to CSS tomorrow.  
There are quite a lot of HTML tags that I don't know, such as `<kbd>`, `<main>`, `<rp>`.

### R1D5 (2021/08/31, I didn't make progress during the weekend)

completed Basic CSS and some of the Applied Visual Design section

### R1D6 (2021/09/02)

completed:

- Applied Visual Design
- Applied Accessibility
- Responsive Web Design Principles
- CSS Flexbox

I felt excited when I was going through the CSS animations. It was amazing! However, is it commonly used in websites on the Internet? It seems to be resource-consuming...

### R1D7 (2021/09/03)

Completed the CSS Grid courses from freeCodeCamp. The courses from freeCodeCamp were part of the curriculum of "HTML and CSS Basics" in The Odin Project. After finishing "HTML and CSS Basics", I moved on to "Developer Tools" to learn about the Chrome develop tool (as I use MS Edge as main browser).

I wished I knew CSS Flexbox and Grid earlier. It makes the stlying much more easier.

### R1D8 (2021/09/04)

I tried to rebuild Google's homepage without using developer tools to inspect the webpage.  
Here is the [link to the project](https://github.com/hrmck/google-homepage)

I am not familiar to CSS flexbox yet and the project took me around 4 hours.

### R1D9 (2021/09/07)

Following the curriculum of the Odin Project, today I started learning about JavaScript.


### R1D10 (2021/09/19)

I entered holiday mode recently...time to come back and continue...  
Btw, the curriculum was changed a bit and some progress was lost!  
Currently working on DOM manuplication in Foundations.
